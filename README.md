# Transformer in visoin :
   The research demonstrates that Transformers, typically used in natural language processing, can be effectively applied to image recognition tasks. 
   This shifts the paradigm from relying heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to using a pure Transformer architecture, which can simplify 
   model design and potentially reduce the need for complex CNN structures.
